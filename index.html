        <h1> Me Vs. Me</h1>
        <p> You have to love you more than anyone else can<br>
            thats why im my biggest fan.</p>
        <p>Through all my flaws and imperfections<br>
        I'll stand forever in my own corner without a question.</p>
        <p><strong>Why?</strong><br>Because its me who sees me in that reflection.<br>
        Me who sees a version of myself I know is destined.</p>
        <p>So with that, I tell myself to embrace it all.<br>
        Along with a reminder everday<br>not to let my crown fall.</p>
        <p>To climb every mountain no mater how tall.<br>Because it's still only Me Vs. Me...<br>
            <em>Win, lose, or draw.<em/><p/>
